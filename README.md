# Mini-Kuzai - YOUTUBE

Automated YouTube Shorts pipeline for **Mini-Kuzai / THE KUZ NETWORK**.

The project converts a validated Mini-Kuzai development step into a short vertical video with a fixed visual identity, dynamic step information, Piper narration, background music and controlled YouTube publication.

## Target YouTube channel

- Channel --> [THE KUZ NETWORK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MDfq5s-6j_twe4xJH_XXA)
- Channel ID --> `UC9MDfq5s-6j_twe4xJH_XXA`
- Usage --> canonical publication target for Mini-Kuzai Shorts

## Current status

**IN PROGRESS --> STEP-00 PROJECT BOOTSTRAP**

Completed:
- GitHub repository created
- project documentation structure defined
- target 1080 x 1920 Short format frozen
- fixed Mini-Kuzai background concept validated
- canonical YouTube channel registered in project documentation

Next:
- finish the initial documentation and GOGIT bootstrap
- clone the repository on `fhc2`
- run the read-only STEP-01 environment audit
- publish the audit through GOGIT

No YouTube API credentials, OAuth tokens or publication automation are configured yet.

## Target pipeline

```text
Mini-Kuzai validated step
        |
        v
structured short brief
        |
        +--> fixed 1080x1920 background
        +--> dynamic Vxx / title / metric overlays
        +--> Piper narration
        +--> background music
        |
        v
Python + FFmpeg renderer
        |
        v
validated MP4
        |
        v
YouTube upload
        |
        v
Short URL + publication receipt
```

The first pilot will use **V79**. The long-term target is to integrate Short generation after a verified Mini-Kuzai FINAL-DEV-FLOW without making YouTube publication a scientific dependency.

## Operating principles

- Work step by step and verify each change.
- Back up an existing file before modifying it.
- Prefer autonomous bounded sequences when intermediate manual validation is not required.
- Publish sanitized command results through GOGIT instead of manually copying successful terminal output.
- Update code and documentation after every completed installation step.
- Never commit OAuth secrets, tokens, passwords, private keys or private data.
- YouTube failure must never invalidate a Mini-Kuzai scientific result.
- Generated videos and temporary render files stay outside Git.
